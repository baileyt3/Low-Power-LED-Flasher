I created this as I had a requirement to have a low power LED flash every 10 seconds, the device
is powered by 3 x CR2032 cells providing 9VDC, so having the circuit use as little power as possible
was paramount.

I tried a few discete designs, but none really provided what I wanted, so I decided to use a low
power TLC555 timer as this keeps the component count low, the chip is available and cheap.

To ensure the lowest current drain, I decided to use the charge on the timing capacitor to flash
the LED, the LED is a nice bright flash so there's no need to use the normal (pin 3) output using
another resistor.

The TLC555 is wired in Astable Multivibrator configuration but with no second timing resistor, this being
replaced with the LED.
